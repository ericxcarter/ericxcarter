- 👋 Hi, I’m @eric.carter, a PM, technical writer, and editor consumed by _[wanderlust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderlust)_ and _[tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku)_ tendencies.
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects&mdash;especially technology, history, usability, linguistics, and _[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)_.
- 🌱 Occasionally, I play around with expressive interactive software such as _[Pyret](https://www.pyret.org/index.html)_ and _[Twine](https://twinery.org/)_.
